    <h3>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h3>
    <hr>

    <h2>The Raid 2</h2>
    <p>What I would describe as the best action movie ever put to film. Violent, gritty, fantastic camera work,
    captivating chartectors. An absolute 10/10 movie.
    </p>

    <h2>Goodfellas</h2>
    <p>Think this one is self explanitory.</p>

    <h2>The Last Dragon</h2>
    <p>Growing up as a kid obsessed with ninjas like the TMNT, 3 Ninjas, and American Ninja, The Last Dragon took 80s cheese,
        fantasticially 80s music and martial arts and made what I will call one of the most rewatchable movies I have ever seen.
